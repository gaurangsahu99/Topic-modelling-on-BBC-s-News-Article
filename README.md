# Topic-modelling-on-BBC-s-News-Article

This README file provides an overview of the Topic Modeling on BBC News Articles Unsupervised ML Project. The project's objective is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to a collection of BBC news articles to discover latent topics within the dataset. This document aims to help users understand the project, its goals, and how to use the provided code and data.

Topic modeling is a powerful technique for extracting hidden topics or themes from a collection of text documents. In this project, we apply unsupervised machine learning to a dataset of BBC news articles. The primary goals of this project are as follows:

Perform text preprocessing to clean and prepare the text data.
Apply topic modeling algorithms (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) to discover latent topics within the news articles.
Visualize and interpret the discovered topics to gain insights into the content of the articles.
Provide a tool to users for exploring the topics within the dataset.

Usage
Preprocess the text data to clean and prepare it for topic modeling.

Apply a topic modeling algorithm to the preprocessed data.

Visualize the discovered topics and their distribution across the articles.

Interpret the topics and their significance within the dataset.
